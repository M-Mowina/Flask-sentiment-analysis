1427960,2,Fun game!,"My son who's 14 really enjoys this game and for the first week, especially, couldn't wait to play it! It is enjoyable and shipping was fast."
514927,2,Disappointed,"The product was great. I am serving with the 101st in Afghanistan and had a family emergency. I needed to cancel my order. About three to four days after sending an email, I was told that the order couldn't be canceled due to it already being shipped. It didn't ship out for a week. I was very disappointed and will not do business again with this company."
3471308,1,It was not what I expected,"I guess I'm in the minority with my low rating, but I was hoping for REAL mulling spices (leaves, flowers, bark, etc.) to boil in my cider (or wine). I wasn't expecting a dissolvable powder. This is more like a powdered drink mix.Heads up for the purists out there!"
2573205,1,No way ... From Shad Dawg,"He sounds way too much like Eminem and a bit of Jay-Z. And his content is weak. Production however is better than a lot out there today Must be a good reason why Tupac hated him so much.Nice Collabo with Killa Priest ,now he is an original artist. You can really feel his music.Peace !!Shad Dawg"

2167037,2,a toss up,"I really love extreme music. When it comes to the most hostile, chilling and vicious sound then Meshuggah gets kudos for being the best. This stuff is as violent as it is flawless. However it isn't alone, as their second album Destroy Erase Improve scores a few points on it in as far as quality goes, this is more intense but not as varied as DEI. Also check out Strapping Young Lad if you like EXTREME music."
1389447,1,Peachtree 2008,Peachtree 2008 is difficult to use in simple applications. The 2000 version is easier for simple applications. The initial screen has part of the writing partially blanked out. It is difficult to write a single check.Roy Huckaby CPA
2012182,2,Classic Cannonball,"This was the very first jazz album I bought, in 1965. It is just an incredible example of the greatness of Cannonball. He takes on some hard-to-play songs, and wails all over them! Just his huge, gorgeous sound is enough reason to buy this album, but the hipness of his note selection puts it way over the top. Because the music is so beautiful, it is a good album to have on for background music, even though it is totally jammin'. It still remains one of my all-time favorite albums, even after 35 years."
2137874,2,perfect fit,The case has worked out great. It's a perfect fit for my canon camera and all the accessories for it.
3094736,2,Wildly Neurotic Western,"Sam Fullers FORTY GUNS is nothing less than a neurotic and a psychologically perplexing and complex story that is truly beyond any measure of rational or conventional storytelling. The more I see it, them more bizarre it looks. Even though he made this at a major studio it is unlike his MERRILL'S MARAUDERS or HOUSE OF BMBOO also made for major studios. It has that definite Fuller look and feel. This is really a fascinating look at emotions gone booth recklessly uncontrolled and painfully restrained beyond the point of reason."
